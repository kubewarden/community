Hello! We are excited that you want to learn more about contributing to the project! This contributor ladder outlines the different contributor roles within
the project, along with the responsibilities and privileges that come with
them. Community members generally start at the first levels of the "ladder" and
advance up it as their involvement in the project grows. Our project members
are happy to help you advance along the contributor ladder.

Each of the contributor roles below is organized into lists of three types of
things. "Responsibilities" are things that a contributor is expected to do.
"Requirements" are qualifications a person needs to meet to be in that role,
and "Privileges" are things contributors on that level are entitled to.

## Contributor

their skillset. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no
specific skill requirements, and no selection process.

permissions to create issues and assign work to themselves for the program
duration.

   [governance](https://github.com/kubewarden/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md)
   rules, select some mentee from the candidates that applied for the mentorship
   program

## Maintainer

Description: Maintainers are first and foremost, committers that have shown
they are committed to the long term success of the project. They are the
planners and designers of the Kubewarden project. Maintainership is about
building trust with the current maintainers of the project and being a person
that they can depend on to make decisions in the best interest of the project
in a consistent manner.

A list of active maintainers can be seen at [MAINTAINERS.md](./MAINTAINERS.md)

- Responsibilities include:
  - Follow the [Kubewarden
    CoC](https://github.com/kubewarden/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

Process of becoming a maintainer:

1. Any current Maintainer may nominate a current contributor to become a new
   Maintainer, by opening a PR against the root of the [community
   repository](https://github.com/kubewarden/community) adding the nominee as an
   Maintainers in the `MAINTAINERS.md` file.
2. The nominee will add a comment to the PR testifying that they agree to all
   requirements of becoming a Maintainer.
3. Following the
   [governance](https://github.com/kubewarden/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md)
   rules. Upon a supermajority (2/3) of votes from active maintainers must then
   approve the PR.

## Inactivity

It is important for contributors to be, and remain, active to set an example and
show commitment to the project. Inactivity is harmful to the project as it may
lead to unexpected delays, contributor attrition, and a lost of trust in the
project.

If a Maintainer is no longer able to perform the maintainer duties listed
above, they should volunteer to be moved to emeritus status. In extreme cases,
maintainers can also be removed from the active maintainers list by a
supermajority (2/3) of votes of existing maintainers.

- Inactivity is measured by:
  - Periods of no contributions for longer than 12 months
  - Periods of no communication for longer than 12 months
- Consequences of being inactive include:
  - Involuntary removal or demotion
  - Being asked to move to Emeritus status

## Involuntary Removal or Demotion

Involuntary removal/demotion of a contributor happens when responsibilities and
requirements aren't being met. This may include repeated patterns of
inactivity, extended period of inactivity, a period of failing to meet the
requirements of your role, and/or a violation of the Code of Conduct. This
process is important because it protects the community and its deliverables
while also opens up opportunities for new contributors to step in.

Involuntary removal or demotion is handled through a vote by a majority of the
current Maintainers. Following the
[governance](https://github.com/kubewarden/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md)
rules

## Stepping Down/Emeritus Process

If and when contributors' commitment levels change, contributors can consider
stepping down (moving down the contributor ladder) vs moving to emeritus status
(completely stepping away from the project).

Contact the Maintainers about changing to Emeritus status, or reducing your
contributor level.
