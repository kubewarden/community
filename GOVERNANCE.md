# GOVERNANCE

This document defines the project governance for Kubewarden. Kubewarden is a
[vendor neutral](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/community/vendor-neutrality/) CNCF project.

# Roles

The Roles in the Kubewarden project can be found in the
[CONTRIBUTOR_LADDER](./CONTRIBUTOR_LADDER.md) file.

# Governance

- The Kubewarden community believes that the best decisions are reached through
  Consensus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making.
- Most decisions, and day-to-day project maintenance is done following the Lazy
  Consensus process: https://communitymgt.wikia.com/wiki/Lazy_consensus.
  If an objection is raised through the Lazy Consensus process, Deciders work
  together to seek an agreeable solution.
- Major changes that touch several parts of the Kubewarden stack are proposed by
  an RFC document, or amending an existing one. See RFC repository:
  https://github.com/kubewarden/rfc
- Community or project level decisions, such as creating a new project,
  maintainer promotion, major updates on GOVERNANCE, or major changes that touch
  several parts of the stack, must be brought to broader awareness of the
  community via community meetings, GitHub discussions, and slack channels. A
  supermajority (2/3) approval from Maintainers is required for such approvals.
- We achieve all of this while following [Kubewarden's Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/kubewarden/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

In general, we prefer that technical issues and maintainer membership are
amicably worked out between the persons involved. If a dispute cannot be decided
independently, the maintainers can be called in to resolve the issue by voting.
A specific statement of what is being voted on should be added to the relevant
github issue or PR. Maintainers should indicate their yes/no vote on that issue
or PR, and after a suitable period of time, the votes will be tallied and the
outcome noted.

# Changing the governance documents

As with other agreements in the project, changes to the governance documents are
submitted via a GitHub pull request to the Project's governance document (this
one). The pull request is then refined in response to public comment and review,
with the goal being consensus in the community.
