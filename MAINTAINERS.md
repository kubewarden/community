# Maintainers

Maintainers are tasked with reviewing issues and pull requests, as well as
guiding the overall direction of the project. For a more detailed explanation
of their roles, you can refer to the project's [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md)
document.

There are two main types of maintainers: "Core Maintainers" and "Maintainers."
Core Maintainers are highly active participants who work on the project
regularly, driving its progress day by day. On the other hand, Maintainers are
those who have previously served as Core Maintainers but are currently less
active. Despite their reduced involvement, they remain valuable contributors.
