# ADOPTERS

This document contains a non-exhaustive list of organizations that adopted
Kubewarden. Please add your organization to the list, with a link to your
organization's website.

Knowing which organizations are adopting Kubewarden is important to us.
Firstly, to our community, as it helps us understand how organizations
benefits from the project.
Secondly, for the project itself. It allows us to better understand how
Kubewarden is being used which helps us to best influence its direction.

Being a CNCF project, Kubewarden requires a list of independent adopters to
grow into the next stage. Sharing that you are using Kubewarden in production
is the most meaningful contribution you can make. A healthy adopter list aids
in moving to the next CNCF stage.

Adopters can also be private, reach out to us at
cncf-kubewarden-maintainers@lists.cncf.io to get involved.
